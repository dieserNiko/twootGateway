Gateway tool to sync Twitter Timeline to Mastodon Account


I use the three scripts above as a combined tool to sync my Twitter-Timeline to a single Mastodon account. I use another account to interact with the first and like, boost and reply to tweets which then gets relayed to my Twitter account. The mastodon server I use is private and not connected to the fediverse as everyone that can see the bot-account for the script can interact with your Twitter timeline in your name! I run each of the scripts as a service.

The whole thing is not the most well programmed thing but it works for now and is enough for me, feel free to optimize things as you like! New twoots also don't work yet.

Currently only photos get reposted well, everything else is only displayed as link, maybe I will change that in the future. 

For questions you can reach out to me @niko@mastodon.bwnet.it or @dieserNiko@twitter.com
